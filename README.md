  _Project Overview
This project provides a Python-based application integrated with the OWASP Dependency Check CLI for running security checks on specified directories. The tool generates a report in HTML format that details vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and directories. It is designed to be used by cyber security analysts and IT professionals for better vulnerability management.

This project is a part of the Algonquin College Software Development Project course (CST8334) and has been developed under the guidance of Professor Asim Javaid Butt.
